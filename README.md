# Family Planner Dashboard

![Family Planner Screenshot](screenshot.png)

**A Skylight Calendar-inspired family command center with voice control, OCR document scanning, AI assistant, and dynamic seasonal themes.**

> Built this because I wanted a fully customizable family hub that I control. Runs on a spare iPad and does everything - voice commands, document scanning, meal planning, chore tracking with celebrations, and ambient video screensavers. No subscriptions, no cloud dependency.

## Features

### 🎙️ Voice Commands (Works Everywhere)
Just talk to it. Uses Web Speech API with OpenAI Whisper fallback for accuracy.

```
"Add dentist appointment Tuesday at 3pm"
"Emma brushed her teeth"
"Plan spaghetti for Wednesday"
"Add eggs to the shopping list"
```

The voice bar is everywhere - calendar, meals, chores, shopping. Speak naturally.

### 📸 OCR Document Scanning
Point your camera at a school flyer, sports schedule, or event poster. The system:
1. Captures the image
2. Sends to Claude Vision API
3. Extracts dates, times, and event names
4. Shows you what it found
5. One click to add to calendar

No more manually typing in school newsletters.

### 🤖 Fia - AI Family Assistant
Chat interface powered by Claude. Ask anything:
- "What's on the calendar today?"
- "What's for dinner?"
- "How are the kids doing with chores?"
- "Add a playdate with the Johnsons on Saturday"

Fia understands context and can modify your calendar, shopping list, and meal plan.

### 📅 Dynamic Calendar with Themes
- **Seasonal backgrounds** - December has snow video, January has sparkles
- **Moon phases** on every day
- **Weather forecast** integration (7-day)
- **Color-coded events** by family member
- **US holidays** built in for 2025-2026

### ⭐ Kids Chore System (No Points!)
We tried the point system. Kids gamed it. Now it's simple:
- Tap a chore when done
- Get a **celebration** (slot machine, confetti, bubble pop)
- That's it. The reward IS the celebration.

Chores auto-reset daily. Parents can see progress at a glance.

### 🍽️ Meal Planning
- Weekly meal grid
- School lunch/breakfast menus (customizable)
- Favorite meals library
- Voice: "Plan pizza for Friday dinner"

### 🛒 Shopping List
- Add items by voice or text
- Check off as you shop
- Syncs across devices

### 📺 Screensaver System
- **Idle screensaver**: Ocean videos play when inactive (configurable timeout)
- **Monthly screensaver**: Click the button to see the current month's themed video
- Videos play at 25% speed for ambient effect

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Backend | Python 3 + built-in HTTPServer |
| Frontend | Vanilla JS, CSS (no frameworks) |
| Voice | Web Speech API + OpenAI Whisper |
| OCR | Claude Vision API |
| AI Chat | Claude API |
| Data | JSON files (simple, portable) |

**Why no frameworks?** This runs on an old iPad as a PWA. Every KB matters. Total JS is under 100KB.
